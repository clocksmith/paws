# Blueprint 0x00003C: Reflection Analysis Engine

**Objective:** Describe the analytics layer that extracts patterns, recommendations, and insights from stored reflections.

**Target Upgrade:** REAN (`reflection-analyzer.js`)

**Prerequisites:** 0x00003B (Reflection Store Architecture), 0x000003 (Core Utilities & Error Handling), 0x00001B (Code Introspection & Self-Analysis)

**Affected Artifacts:** `/upgrades/reflection-analyzer.js`, `/styles/dashboard.css`, `/upgrades/reflection-store.js`

### 1. The Strategic Imperative
Captured reflections only become useful when transformed into guidance. The analyzer:
- Identifies recurring success strategies.
- Detects failure clusters needing remediation.
- Suggests actionable next steps for the agent and human operators.

### 2. Architectural Overview
The analyzer is a thin compute module that consumes `ReflectionStore` data and outputs insights.

```javascript
const Analyzer = await ModuleLoader.getModule('ReflectionAnalyzer');
const insights = await Analyzer.api.getLearningInsights();
```

Key capabilities:
- **Keyword Extraction**
  - Tokenises descriptions using simple heuristics (`getKeywords`), feeding similarity calculations.
- **Clustering**
  - `clusterReflections(minClusterSize)` groups reflections via Jaccard similarity on keywords.
  - Summaries include size, success rate, common tags, and dominant keywords.
- **Failure Pattern Detection**
  - Regex-based indicators (syntax, type, timeout, network, etc.) aggregated from failure descriptions.
  - Each indicator maps to curated recommendations from `generateRecommendations`.
- **Success Strategy Mining**
  - Scans tags/keywords for strategy prefixes (`strategy_`, `approach_`) and generic success terms.
- **Solution Recommendation**
  - `recommendSolution(problemText)` finds similar reflections and returns top recommendations with confidence score.
- **Learning Insights**
  - Aggregates clusters, failure patterns, success strategies, and general recommendations into a dashboard-friendly object.

### 3. Implementation Pathway
1. **Data Retrieval**
   - Pull reflections via `ReflectionStore.getReflections({ limit: N })` â€“ default 100 for recent context.
   - Ensure store initialised; handle empty dataset gracefully.
2. **Similarity & Clustering**
   - Use Jaccard similarity threshold (~0.3) to merge reflections with overlapping keywords.
   - Expose clusters sorted by size for UI charts.
3. **Failure Analysis**
   - Maintain regex map to detect common error categories.
   - Limit exemplar storage (max 3) for each indicator to avoid bloated payloads.
4. **Recommendation Generation**
   - Combine failure-driven actions (reduce errors) with success amplification (continue best strategies).
   - Always include baseline best-practice guidance.
5. **Integration Points**
   - Expose results via Observability panel; tie into tutorial or reflection review flows.
   - Provide APIs to `ReflectionSearch` and persona heuristics.

### 4. Verification Checklist
- [ ] Analyzer handles < `minClusterSize` reflections (returns empty array).
- [ ] Failure pattern summariser distinguishes between failure vs success outcomes.
- [ ] `recommendSolution` returns `found: false` with helpful message when no matches.
- [ ] Learning insights include summary counts, success rate, clusters, failure patterns, recommendations.
- [ ] Keyword extraction avoids short/stop words (length > 3).

### 5. Extension Opportunities
- Replace keyword heuristics with TF-IDF or embedding-based similarity for richer results.
- Integrate with visualization dashboards (heat maps of failure indicators).
- Schedule periodic analysis and surface digest in notifications.
- Cross-link reflections to blueprint improvements automatically.

Maintain this blueprint as analysis techniques evolve or new insight categories are introduced.
