```

### Module Architecture

REPLOID uses a Dependency Injection (DI) container pattern with 40+ modules:

**Core Systems:**
- DIContainer, EventBus, Utils, StateManager, Storage
- ApiClient, ToolRunner, SentinelFSM
- GitVFS, DiffViewerUI, UIManager

**Full list:** See `config.json` module registry

### Data Flow

1. User sets goal → Sentinel FSM enters CURATING_CONTEXT
2. Agent selects files → Creates cats.md context bundle
3. User approves context → FSM enters PLANNING_WITH_CONTEXT
4. Agent generates proposal → Creates dogs.md change bundle
5. User reviews diff → Selective file approval in DiffViewerUI
6. FSM creates checkpoint → Applies approved changes
7. FSM enters REFLECTING → Agent learns from outcome
