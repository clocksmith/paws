# RFC Status Overview

## Active RFCs and Implementation Status

This document tracks the status of all RFCs (Request for Comments) in the REPLOID project, their implementation progress, and relationships between them.

---

## 🟢 **Project Sentinel** (RFC 2025-09-22)
**Status: 100% COMPLETE** ✅
**Codename:** "The Sentinel Agent"

### Purpose
Transform REPLOID into a Sentinel Agent with human-in-the-loop approvals, implementing the PAWS philosophy within a browser environment.

### Implementation Status
- ✅ Core modules created and integrated (`sentinel-tools.js`, `sentinel-fsm.js`, `diff-viewer-ui.js`, `git-vfs.js`)
- ✅ Session-based workspaces (`/sessions/`)
- ✅ Human approval states (AWAITING_CONTEXT_APPROVAL, AWAITING_PROPOSAL_APPROVAL)
- ✅ cats.md/dogs.md bundle creation and parsing
- ✅ Interactive diff viewer with selective approval
- ✅ Checkpoint/rollback system
- ✅ REFLECTING state for learning
- ✅ Full integration into main application
- ✅ **COMPLETED TODAY**: Fixed apply_dogs_bundle parsing logic
- ✅ **COMPLETED TODAY**: Added Web Worker verification (`verification-worker.js`, `verification-manager.js`)

### What's Working
Complete Sentinel Agent flow from goal → context curation → approval → proposal → approval → apply → reflect

### Files Created
- `upgrades/sentinel-tools.js`
- `upgrades/sentinel-fsm.js`
- `upgrades/diff-viewer-ui.js`
- `upgrades/git-vfs.js`
- `upgrades/apply-dogs-implementation.js`

## 🟡 **Project Phoenix** (RFC 2025-09-22)
**Status: 40% Implemented - SUPERSEDED**
**Codename:** "Rising from the Ashes"

### Purpose
Modernize REPLOID's architecture with DI Container, Event Bus, and FSM patterns.

### Implementation Status
- ✅ DI Container (`di-container.js`)
- ✅ Event Bus (`event-bus.js`)
- ✅ Standardized module format
- ❌ Original Phoenix FSM (replaced by Sentinel FSM)
- ❌ Full dashboard UI (partially implemented)

### Relationship to Other RFCs
Phoenix provided the architectural foundation that Sentinel built upon. Its core improvements (DI, Event Bus) are live in production.

## 🟢 **PAWS CLI Integration** (RFC 2025-09-07)
**Status: 100% COMPLETE** ✅
**Codename:** "The Ouroboros Stack"

### Purpose
Create a unified system integrating PAWS philosophy, Claude Code CLI tools, and REPLOID's autonomous capabilities.

### Implementation Status
- ✅ PAWS philosophy integrated via Sentinel
- ✅ Core PAWS tools in browser (`create_cats_bundle`, `create_dogs_bundle`, `apply_dogs_bundle`)
- ✅ AI-powered context curation (in `sentinel-tools.js`)
- ✅ Full dogs.md parsing with checkpoint/rollback
- ✅ Web Worker sandboxed verification execution
- ✅ Verification manager with test/lint/type-check support
- ✅ **COMPLETED NOW**: cats CLI script (`bin/cats`) - Creates context bundles with pattern matching
- ✅ **COMPLETED NOW**: dogs CLI script (`bin/dogs`) - Applies change bundles with verification
- ✅ **COMPLETED NOW**: Project Hermes foundation (`hermes/index.js`) - Full Node.js port
- ✅ **COMPLETED NOW**: Git worktree session management in Hermes
- ✅ **COMPLETED NOW**: WebSocket bridge for browser-server communication
- ✅ **COMPLETED NOW**: Session isolation and checkpoint system

### What's Working
Complete PAWS ecosystem from browser to CLI to server, with full Sentinel Agent implementation across all platforms.

### Relationship to Other RFCs
PAWS CLI introduced the philosophy that Sentinel implemented. The Ouroboros Stack vision is now fully realized with Node.js port complete.

## ❌ **Local LLM in Browser** (RFC 2025-05-10)
**Status: 0% Implemented**
**Codename:** "Project Prometheus" (proposed)

### Purpose
Enable client-side execution of Gemma 3 27B model using WebGPU and GGUF format.

### Implementation Status
- ❌ No WebGPU implementation
- ❌ No GGUF loader
- ❌ No Gemma model integration
- 📄 Research document only

### Future Potential
This remains a long-term research goal. Would require significant effort and may not be feasible with current browser limitations.

---

## 🚀 **Proposed Future Projects**

### **Project Aegis** 🛡️ (Next Priority)
Complete security hardening of Sentinel implementation:
- Web Worker sandboxing for code execution
- Permission system for VFS access
- Audit logging for all agent actions

### ~~**Project Hermes** 🪽~~ ✅ COMPLETED
~~Node.js port for server-side operation:~~
- ✅ Migrated REPLOID from browser to Node.js
- ✅ Implemented Git worktree session management
- ✅ WebSocket bridge for browser UI
**NOW PART OF PAWS CLI INTEGRATION**

### **Project Athena** 🦉
Learning and adaptation capabilities:
- Persistent learning across sessions
- Pattern recognition from successes/failures
- Knowledge base from reflection insights

### **Project Chronos** ⏰
Time travel debugging using Git VFS:
- Visual timeline of agent actions
- Rewind capability to any previous state
- Checkpoint branching for exploration

---
