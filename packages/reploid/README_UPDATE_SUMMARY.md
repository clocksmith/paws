# README Update Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ✓ Complete

---

## Changes Made

Updated REPLOID README.md to accurately reflect the **100% self-contained architecture** with optional PAWS interoperability.

---

## Key Updates

### 1. New Section: "Self-Contained Architecture" (Lines 144-164)

**Replaced:** "PAWS Integration" section that incorrectly stated dependencies

**Now States:**
- ✓ REPLOID is 100% self-contained
- ✓ Zero external dependencies
- ✓ Browser-native DOGS/CATS parser (DGPR module)
- ✓ Genesis snapshot system (GENS module)
- ✓ No dependency on @paws/parsers or @paws/cli-js
- ⚠️ Optional PAWS compatibility through bundle format

**Key Quote:**
> "REPLOID is **100% self-contained** and runs entirely in the browser with **zero external dependencies**"

---

### 2. Updated: "Relationship to PAWS" (Lines 699-709)

**Before:**
- Stated "REPLOID integrates with PAWS CLI tools"
- Implied dependency on PAWS

**After:**
- States "REPLOID is **independently capable**"
- Clarifies PAWS is **optional**
- Explains REPLOID provides its own implementations

**Key Quote:**
> "REPLOID runs 100% in the browser without requiring PAWS installation. The two projects share format compatibility but REPLOID is fully self-contained."

---

### 3. Renamed Section: "Integration with PAWS CLI" → "Optional PAWS CLI Interoperability" (Lines 713-751)

**Before:**
- Listed PAWS tools as if REPLOID used them directly
- Said "Shared Tools: REPLOID uses the same core tools as PAWS"

**After:**
- Shows PAWS workflow as **optional**
- Provides browser-only alternative workflow
- Lists REPLOID's native modules (DGPR, DIFF, VRFY, GENS)

**New Code Example:**
```javascript
// REPLOID's native browser-only workflow (no CLI needed)
const DogsParser = window.DIContainer.resolve('DogsParserBrowser');
const ToolRunner = window.DIContainer.resolve('ToolRunner');

// Create DOGS bundle in browser
const changes = [{ operation: 'CREATE', file_path: '/new.js', new_content: '...' }];
const dogsBundle = DogsParser.createDogsBundle(changes);

// Apply changes in browser
await ToolRunner.runTool('apply_dogs_bundle', { dogs_path: '/changes.dogs.md' });
```

---

### 4. Updated Module Counts

**Blueprints:**
- Before: "70+ blueprints"
- After: "67 blueprints" (0x000001-0x000049)

**Upgrades:**
- Before: "70+ upgrades"
- After: "72 upgrades" (added DIFF and VRFY)

**Module List Updated:**
- Added: `dogs-parser-browser.js`, `genesis-snapshot.js`, `diff-utils.js`, `verification-manager.js`
- Updated: `agent-cycle-structured.js`, `webrtc-coordinator.js`

## What README Now Communicates

### ✓ Clear Messages

1. **Self-Contained**: REPLOID runs 100% in browser, no external dependencies
2. **PAWS-Like Features**: Implements DOGS/CATS parsing, but browser-native
3. **Optional Interop**: Can work with PAWS CLI, but doesn't require it
4. **Format Compatible**: DOGS/CATS bundles work across both systems
5. **Independent**: Full functionality without PAWS installation

### ✓ Accurate Technical Details

- Lists correct modules: DGPR, GENS, DIFF, VRFY
- Shows browser-only workflow examples
- Clarifies no dependency on @paws/* packages
- Explains genesis snapshot system
- Documents verification manager

### ✓ Proper Positioning

**REPLOID:**
- Browser-native RSI framework
- Self-contained implementation
- Visual interface for self-modification
- Complete runtime environment

**PAWS (optional):**
- CLI-based workflows
- Git worktree integration
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Format compatibility partner

---

## Before vs After Comparison

### Before (Incorrect)

> "**PAWS Integration**
>
> REPLOID integrates with PAWS (Python/JavaScript CLI tools) for enhanced workflows:
>
> - **CLI Tools**: Use `npx cats` and `npx dogs` from `@paws/cli-js`
> - **Shared Parser**: Uses `@paws/parsers`
> - **Shared Tools**: REPLOID uses the same core tools as PAWS"

**Problem:** Implies REPLOID depends on PAWS packages

---

### After (Correct)

> "**Self-Contained Architecture**
>
> REPLOID is **100% self-contained** and runs entirely in the browser with **zero external dependencies**:
>
> - **Browser-Native DOGS/CATS Parser** (`DGPR` module) - No dependency on `@paws/parsers`
> - **Genesis Snapshot System** (`GENS` module) - Tracks RSI evolution
> - **No Node.js Dependencies** - Pure browser implementation
>
> ### PAWS Compatibility (Optional)
>
> While fully self-contained, REPLOID **can optionally** interoperate with PAWS CLI tools:
> - **No Dependency**: PAWS CLI tools are **not required**"

**Correct:** States independence clearly, PAWS is optional
