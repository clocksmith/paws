1. what ecactly is in the boot html/js? does it load any upgrades/modules?
or does have it have simple versions of things it needs to boot, or both?

2. showBootMode selection should only have 3, minimial-rsi, rsi-core, and then experimental (no full featured)

3.  /api/generate should not post with max tokens of 8192, unless the model is inforfmed of that in prompt, why 8192? can it be h igher? Temperasture should default to 1.0

4. for main inference endpoints, we should bea ble to use a streaming version, right?

re Q1

1. Why does it load Chart.js, D3.js, Acorn (JS parser)
    - PrismJS (syntax highlighting)
    - WebLLM library (for WebGPU inference, loaded but not used in 1 ollama setup)
    - isomorphic-git and LightningFS (for VFS, lines 702-704)

The boot should be mininmal, only the modules that actually need these should lazxily load them, etc

2.
    - integrations/claude-code/workflows/console-monitor.js (line 705)
    - integrations/claude-code/workflows/live-reload.js (line 706)

Why these?

3. in step 1, Creates VFS using isomorphic-git (lines 710-757)
 why isomorphic-git, is there a more simple VFS module?
 Exmaple, in step 3, it uses 4. Writes everything to IndexedDB VFS using LightningFS (lines 730-740)

What is LightningFS, is there a simpler VHS model (indexedDB or not) that doesnt have 3rd party deps. We want to avoid 3rd party deps.

the stuff in awakenAgent() should be known as the gensis cycle (cycle 0), its unique and eost not follow app-logic, but iut should be preserved and shown to the user before starting cycle 1


re Q2: we can remove double/unsued mapings and defitions, just keep the 3

re Q3, make this consistent, temperature 1.0, max tokens 8192, and inform this limitation in system prompt.

re Q4: use the streaming version



1. how many more personas than /personas/CodeRefactorerPersona.js
 and how are they chosen


 2. why two types? can these be consisstenty (only use 1?)

 3. whats the diff betweeen app-logic.js and CycleLogic? and AgentCycle

 4. vfs-explorer should not have its own css file, it must be bundled with the module itself. no module should have a sep css file, escept dashboard.css, which we make conisder renaming to ui-core
