## Appendix B: Goal Statement

The MCP Widget Protocol (MCP-WP) standardizes visual representation of Anthropic's Model Context Protocol servers in dashboard applications. It defines contracts for creating Web Components that display MCP tools, resources, and prompts with safe rendering, dependency injection for host services (EventBus, MCPBridge, Theme, A11yHelper), and lifecycle management.

Through strict interfaces, MCP-WP ensures security via declarative permission models, user confirmation for tool invocations, XSS prevention for server data, and JSON Schema validation for tool arguments. The protocol includes enterprise-grade features: WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility requirements, widget registry protocol for distribution, conformance testing framework for quality assurance, and inter-widget communication for composite workflows.

The protocol formalizes interoperability with the community-driven mcp-ui standard, positioning MCP-WP as a collaborative formalization rather than a competitive replacement. It enables developers to build consistent, reusable widgets for any MCP server (GitHub, Slack, Supabase) that integrate seamlessly with host dashboards while maintaining visual consistency, security, and predictable behavior across the MCP ecosystem.
