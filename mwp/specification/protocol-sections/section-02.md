## Abstract

This specification defines the MCP Widget Protocol (MWP), a contract-based system for creating visual dashboard widgets that represent Model Context Protocol servers. MWP establishes strict interfaces for widget lifecycle, MCP server communication, and visual rendering of MCP primitives (tools, resources, prompts). Widgets are implemented as Web Components with Shadow DOM encapsulation and integrate with host-provided services via dependency injection.
