**Title**: Proposal: Dashboard Observability Layer for MCP Servers

**Category**: Ideas / Enhancements

---

### Message Body

Hi MCP Team,

We've been building a **dashboard/observability protocol** for MCP servers and wanted to share our approach with you, in case it's useful for the broader ecosystem.

### Background

**Context**: This is separate from [mcp-ui](https://github.com/idosal/mcp-ui), which delivers rich UI **in** MCP responses. We're focused on external dashboards **about** MCP servers—like Grafana for observability.

We noticed that MCP deployments lack standardized dashboards for:
1. **Operational monitoring** - Real-time view of tool invocations across servers
2. **User confirmation** - Approval workflows before executing dangerous operations
3. **Audit logging** - Compliance trails showing what operations occurred when
4. **Administrative control** - Centralized management of multiple MCP servers

This creates operational and security gaps, particularly for enterprise deployments.

### What We've Built

We created **MCP Widget Protocol (MWP)**, a client-side dashboard standard that provides:

1. **Dashboard Widgets** for MCP servers
   - Web Components that visualize server operations
   - Real-time display of tool invocations, resources, prompts
   - Works with **any standard MCP server** (no modifications needed)

2. **User Confirmation Layer**
   - Approval dialogs before tool execution
   - Visual display of tool names and arguments
   - Explicit approve/reject flow

3. **Observability**
   - Event-driven architecture for logging all MCP operations
   - Audit trails for compliance requirements
   - Real-time monitoring across multiple servers

4. **Example Implementation**
   - Working GitHub dashboard widget showing tool activity
   - Demo: [link]
   - Simplified Spec: [link to MWP-SIMPLE.md]

### Example Flow

```
Dashboard shows GitHub MCP server widget
User clicks "Create Issue" in dashboard
  ↓
Dashboard requests tool execution via standard MCP
  ↓
MWP layer intercepts and shows confirmation:
  "GitHub server wants to create_issue with:
   repo: owner/repo
   title: Bug report
   [Cancel] [Approve]"
  ↓
On approval: Tool executes via standard MCP protocol
On cancel: Operation rejected
  ↓
Result logged to audit trail
Dashboard updates to show completed operation
```

### Questions for MCP Team

We'd love your thoughts on:

1. **MCP Ecosystem Alignment**
   - Is there value in standardizing dashboard/observability for MCP?
   - Would MCP spec benefit from documenting operational best practices?
   - Are there plans for official dashboard guidance?

2. **Relationship to mcp-ui**
   - We see mcp-ui and MWP as complementary (response UI vs dashboards)
   - Should we clarify this distinction in both projects' docs?
   - Any concerns about ecosystem confusion?

3. **Collaboration Opportunities**
   - Would Anthropic be interested in co-authoring observability guidance?
   - Should this be proposed as an RFC or ecosystem resource?
   - Are there enterprise operational requirements we should address?

4. **Direction Check**
   - Is dashboard observability a real ecosystem need?
   - Are there concerns we haven't considered?
   - Any conflicts with Anthropic's plans?

### Not Asking For

We're **not** proposing:
- Changes to MCP protocol itself
- New MCP message types or primitives
- Modifications to MCP server behavior
- Official Anthropic maintenance of our code
- Anything that conflicts with mcp-ui (different use case)

We **are** proposing:
- Standardized dashboards for MCP operational monitoring
- Reference implementation for observability patterns
- Client-side only (works with any standard MCP server)
- Complementary to mcp-ui (not competitive)

### GO/NO-GO Decision

Based on your response, we'll either:

**GO** - You see value, we proceed with:
- Documenting observability patterns for MCP ecosystem
- Co-authoring dashboard implementation guidance
- Positioning MWP as reference implementation
- Continuing active development

**NO-GO** - You have concerns or different direction:
- We pivot or sunset the project
- Avoid claiming MCP alignment
- Focus elsewhere

We respect that Anthropic may have different plans for MCP ecosystem, and we don't want to create confusion or fragmentation.

### Demo

You can try the working demo here: [link]

It shows a GitHub MCP server dashboard with tool monitoring, user confirmation before execution, audit logging, and full TypeScript integration.

What do you think? Is this a direction worth pursuing?

Thanks for building MCP - it's an incredibly valuable protocol, and we want to make sure our work aligns with your vision.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Follow-Up Strategy

### If Positive Response ("This is interesting...")
1. **Thank them immediately**
2. **Offer to write security best practices doc**
   - Pull request to MCP documentation
   - Co-author with MCP team input
   - Reference implementation links
3. **Propose RFC if appropriate**
   - Formal enhancement proposal
   - Community feedback period
   - Integration with MCP spec
4. **Continue development confidently**

### If Neutral Response ("We'll consider it...")
1. **Thank them for considering**
2. **Ask for specific feedback**
   - What aspects are concerning?
   - What would make this more valuable?
   - Timeline for decision?
3. **Offer to iterate**
   - Revise based on feedback
   - Come back with v2 proposal
4. **Proceed cautiously**
   - Don't claim official alignment
   - Keep door open for future

### If Negative Response ("Not aligned with our plans...")
1. **Thank them for honest feedback**
2. **Ask about their plans**
   - Are you building official client UI?
   - What direction should ecosystem take?
   - How can we avoid conflicts?
3. **Make NO-GO decision**
   - Archive the project
   - Document why we stopped
   - Avoid confusing ecosystem
4. **Respect their direction**

### If No Response After 2 Weeks
1. **Gentle follow-up comment**
   - "Just bumping this in case it got buried"
   - Offer to provide more context
   - No pressure
2. **Wait another week (3 weeks total)**
3. **After 3 weeks, make decision:**
   - **Assume cautious interest** if no negative response
   - **Proceed independently** but don't claim official alignment
   - **Document outreach attempt** ("We reached out on [date]")
   - **Keep door open** for future collaboration
4. **Don't claim endorsement without explicit approval**

## Key Messages to Emphasize

✅ **DO Emphasize:**
- MCP is great, we're building on top
- Security gap in current client implementations
- Want to align with Anthropic's vision
- Happy to pivot based on feedback
- Offering to contribute to official docs
- Respecting MCP team's authority

❌ **DON'T Say:**
- MCP spec is incomplete
- We're building the standard
- Everyone should use MWP
- This is what MCP needs
- Implying official endorsement

## Success Criteria

**Best case**: Anthropic sees value, we co-author security docs, get endorsement
**Good case**: Positive feedback, proceed with community blessing
**Acceptable case**: No strong objection, proceed independently
**Worst case**: Negative response, we pivot or sunset

## GO/NO-GO Decision Matrix

| Response | Decision | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| "This is great, let's collaborate" | **GO** | Full speed ahead, official alignment |
| "Interesting, keep us posted" | **GO** | Proceed independently, stay in touch |
| "We'll consider it" | **GO** | Proceed cautiously, await feedback |
| No response after 3 weeks | **GO** | Proceed independently, no false claims |
| "Not aligned with our plans" | **NO-GO** | Pause or pivot significantly |
| "We're building our own solution" | **NO-GO** | Stop to avoid competition |
| "Security concerns" | **PIVOT** | Address concerns, then re-propose |

## What to Avoid

1. **Don't claim official status** without explicit approval
2. **Don't position as "the" MCP client UI** - just "a" client UI
3. **Don't imply Anthropic endorsement** without written permission
4. **Don't compete with official Anthropic plans** if they reveal any
5. **Don't create confusion** in MCP ecosystem

## Backup Plan

If Anthropic is unresponsive or negative:

1. **Document outreach clearly**
   - "We reached out to Anthropic on [date]"
   - "We did not receive endorsement"
   - "This is a community project, not official"

2. **Position appropriately**
   - "Community-driven security layer for MCP"
   - "One approach to client-side visualization"
   - "Compatible with standard MCP servers"

3. **Avoid false claims**
   - Never say "official" or "endorsed"
   - Don't imply Anthropic involvement
   - Be honest about independent status

4. **Stay open to future collaboration**
   - Check in every 6 months
   - Share any significant traction
   - Remain respectful and aligned

## Critical Success Factor

**We need explicit Anthropic approval or at least no objection to proceed confidently.**

If we get neither after reasonable outreach attempts, we can proceed independently but must be crystal clear about community-driven, non-official status.
