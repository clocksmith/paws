**Title**: Proposal: Security Best Practices for MCP Client UIs

**Category**: Ideas / Enhancements

---

### Message Body

Hi MCP Team,

We've been building client-side visualizations for MCP servers and wanted to share our approach to security and observability, in case it's useful for the broader ecosystem or MCP specification.

### Background

We noticed that many MCP client implementations lack:
1. **User confirmation** before tool execution (especially for write operations)
2. **Audit logging** of MCP operations
3. **Visual feedback** about what tools are being invoked

This creates potential security and trust issues, particularly for enterprise deployments.

### What We've Built

We created **MCP Widget Protocol (MWP)**, a client-side framework that adds:

1. **Security Layer**
   - User confirmation dialogs before tool execution
   - Visual display of tool names and arguments
   - Explicit approve/reject flow

2. **Observability**
   - Event-driven architecture for logging all MCP operations
   - Audit trails for compliance
   - Real-time monitoring of tool invocations

3. **Example Implementation**
   - Working GitHub widget with confirmation flow
   - Demo: [link]
   - Spec: [link to MWP-SIMPLE.md]

### Example Flow

```
User clicks "Create Issue"
  ↓
Widget requests tool execution
  ↓
MCP Bridge intercepts and emits event
  ↓
Client shows confirmation dialog:
  "GitHub wants to create_issue with:
   repo: owner/repo
   title: Bug report
   [Cancel] [Approve]"
  ↓
On approval: Tool executes
On cancel: Operation rejected
  ↓
Result logged to audit trail
```

### Questions for MCP Team

We'd love your thoughts on:

1. **MCP Spec Alignment**
   - Should user confirmation be part of MCP client implementation guidance?
   - Would MCP spec benefit from documenting security best practices?
   - Are there plans for official MCP client UI guidelines?

2. **Collaboration Opportunities**
   - Would Anthropic be interested in co-authoring security guidance?
   - Should this be proposed as an RFC enhancement to MCP spec?
   - Are there enterprise security requirements we should address?

3. **Direction Check**
   - Is this the right direction for MCP client UIs?
   - Are there concerns we haven't considered?
   - Would official endorsement of these patterns be appropriate?

### Not Asking For

We're **not** proposing:
- Changes to MCP protocol itself
- New MCP message types
- Modifications to server behavior
- Official Anthropic maintenance of our code

We **are** proposing:
- Document security best practices for MCP clients
- Provide reference implementation (MWP)
- Collaborate on security guidance

### GO/NO-GO Decision

Based on your response, we'll either:

**GO** - You see value, we proceed with:
- Submitting security best practices to MCP docs
- Co-authoring client implementation guide
- Positioning MWP as reference implementation
- Continuing active development

**NO-GO** - You have concerns or different direction:
- We pivot or sunset the project
- Avoid claiming MCP alignment
- Focus elsewhere

We respect that Anthropic may have different plans for MCP ecosystem, and we don't want to create confusion or fragmentation.

### Demo

You can try the working demo here: [link]

It shows a GitHub widget with user confirmation before tool execution, audit logging, and full TypeScript integration.

### Links

- **Simplified Spec**: [MWP-SIMPLE.md]
- **GitHub Repo**: [link]
- **Demo**: [link]
- **Compatibility with mcp-ui**: [link to adapter]

What do you think? Is this a direction worth pursuing?

Thanks for building MCP - it's an incredibly valuable protocol, and we want to make sure our work aligns with your vision.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Follow-Up Strategy

### If Positive Response ("This is interesting...")
1. **Thank them immediately**
2. **Offer to write security best practices doc**
   - Pull request to MCP documentation
   - Co-author with MCP team input
   - Reference implementation links
3. **Propose RFC if appropriate**
   - Formal enhancement proposal
   - Community feedback period
   - Integration with MCP spec
4. **Continue development confidently**

### If Neutral Response ("We'll consider it...")
1. **Thank them for considering**
2. **Ask for specific feedback**
   - What aspects are concerning?
   - What would make this more valuable?
   - Timeline for decision?
3. **Offer to iterate**
   - Revise based on feedback
   - Come back with v2 proposal
4. **Proceed cautiously**
   - Don't claim official alignment
   - Keep door open for future

### If Negative Response ("Not aligned with our plans...")
1. **Thank them for honest feedback**
2. **Ask about their plans**
   - Are you building official client UI?
   - What direction should ecosystem take?
   - How can we avoid conflicts?
3. **Make NO-GO decision**
   - Archive the project
   - Document why we stopped
   - Avoid confusing ecosystem
4. **Respect their direction**

### If No Response After 2 Weeks
1. **Gentle follow-up comment**
   - "Just bumping this in case it got buried"
   - Offer to provide more context
   - No pressure
2. **Wait another week (3 weeks total)**
3. **After 3 weeks, make decision:**
   - **Assume cautious interest** if no negative response
   - **Proceed independently** but don't claim official alignment
   - **Document outreach attempt** ("We reached out on [date]")
   - **Keep door open** for future collaboration
4. **Don't claim endorsement without explicit approval**

## Key Messages to Emphasize

✅ **DO Emphasize:**
- MCP is great, we're building on top
- Security gap in current client implementations
- Want to align with Anthropic's vision
- Happy to pivot based on feedback
- Offering to contribute to official docs
- Respecting MCP team's authority

❌ **DON'T Say:**
- MCP spec is incomplete
- We're building the standard
- Everyone should use MWP
- This is what MCP needs
- Implying official endorsement

## Success Criteria

**Best case**: Anthropic sees value, we co-author security docs, get endorsement
**Good case**: Positive feedback, proceed with community blessing
**Acceptable case**: No strong objection, proceed independently
**Worst case**: Negative response, we pivot or sunset

## GO/NO-GO Decision Matrix

| Response | Decision | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| "This is great, let's collaborate" | **GO** | Full speed ahead, official alignment |
| "Interesting, keep us posted" | **GO** | Proceed independently, stay in touch |
| "We'll consider it" | **GO** | Proceed cautiously, await feedback |
| No response after 3 weeks | **GO** | Proceed independently, no false claims |
| "Not aligned with our plans" | **NO-GO** | Pause or pivot significantly |
| "We're building our own solution" | **NO-GO** | Stop to avoid competition |
| "Security concerns" | **PIVOT** | Address concerns, then re-propose |

## What to Avoid

1. **Don't claim official status** without explicit approval
2. **Don't position as "the" MCP client UI** - just "a" client UI
3. **Don't imply Anthropic endorsement** without written permission
4. **Don't compete with official Anthropic plans** if they reveal any
5. **Don't create confusion** in MCP ecosystem

## Backup Plan

If Anthropic is unresponsive or negative:

1. **Document outreach clearly**
   - "We reached out to Anthropic on [date]"
   - "We did not receive endorsement"
   - "This is a community project, not official"

2. **Position appropriately**
   - "Community-driven security layer for MCP"
   - "One approach to client-side visualization"
   - "Compatible with standard MCP servers"

3. **Avoid false claims**
   - Never say "official" or "endorsed"
   - Don't imply Anthropic involvement
   - Be honest about independent status

4. **Stay open to future collaboration**
   - Check in every 6 months
   - Share any significant traction
   - Remain respectful and aligned

## Critical Success Factor

**We need explicit Anthropic approval or at least no objection to proceed confidently.**

If we get neither after reasonable outreach attempts, we can proceed independently but must be crystal clear about community-driven, non-official status.
