# MWP Collaboration Strategy

This directory contains templates and guidance for collaborating with the MCP ecosystem.

## Philosophy

**MWP enhances existing solutions rather than replacing them.**

We're collaborating with mcp-ui and Anthropic to bring security and observability to MCP visualizations.

## Outreach Plan

### Week 1: mcp-ui Collaboration
- **File**: [MCP-UI-OUTREACH.md](./MCP-UI-OUTREACH.md)
- **Action**: Reach out to Ido Salomon via GitHub issue
- **Goal**: Discuss collaboration, offer to contribute security features
- **Success**: Partnership, PRs to mcp-ui, or friendly coordination

### Week 2: Anthropic Alignment
- **File**: [ANTHROPIC-OUTREACH.md](./ANTHROPIC-OUTREACH.md)
- **Action**: Post in MCP GitHub Discussions
- **Goal**: Get feedback on security approach, avoid conflicts
- **Success**: Positive response or at least no objection

### Week 3-4: Evaluate and Decide
Based on responses, make GO/NO-GO decision for continued development.

## Decision Framework

### GO Criteria (Proceed with Development)
- ‚úÖ Positive response from mcp-ui OR Anthropic
- ‚úÖ No objection from either after reasonable outreach
- ‚úÖ Clear path to collaboration or peaceful coexistence
- ‚úÖ Value proposition remains strong

### NO-GO Criteria (Pause or Pivot)
- ‚ùå Explicit objection from Anthropic
- ‚ùå Anthropic announces competing solution
- ‚ùå mcp-ui maintainer requests we stop
- ‚ùå Technical/security concerns we can't address

### PIVOT Criteria (Adjust Approach)
- üîÑ Feedback suggests different direction
- üîÑ Better alignment opportunity identified
- üîÑ Ecosystem needs evolve
- üîÑ mcp-ui wants different contribution

## What We're Offering

### To mcp-ui
1. Security layer (user confirmation before tool execution)
2. Event system (audit logging for observability)
3. TypeScript SDK (type-safe widget development)
4. Compatibility adapter (MWP widgets work in mcp-ui)
5. Ongoing maintenance and support

### To Anthropic MCP Team
1. Security best practices documentation
2. Reference implementation for secure clients
3. Community contribution to MCP ecosystem
4. Real-world testing and feedback
5. Enterprise security patterns

### To Developers
1. Type-safe widget development
2. Security built-in by default
3. Observability for debugging
4. Compatibility with existing tools
5. Clear documentation and examples

## Key Principles

1. **Credit Existing Work**
   - mcp-ui pioneered MCP visualization
   - Anthropic created MCP protocol
   - We're building on their foundation

2. **Avoid Fragmentation**
   - One ecosystem is better than multiple competing approaches
   - Seek compatibility and collaboration first
   - Only diverge if absolutely necessary

3. **Listen and Adapt**
   - Feedback from maintainers takes priority
   - Willing to pivot based on ecosystem needs
   - No ego about "our way"

4. **Be Honest**
   - Don't claim official status without approval
   - Acknowledge independent/community-driven nature
   - Transparent about limitations and tradeoffs

5. **Focus on Value**
   - Security and observability are real needs
   - Solve actual problems, not theoretical ones
   - Validate with real users

## Success Metrics

**Month 1:**
- [ ] Outreach completed to both mcp-ui and Anthropic
- [ ] At least one positive response or constructive feedback
- [ ] Demo video published showing security features
- [ ] GitHub repo public with simplified spec

**Month 2:**
- [ ] Clear collaboration agreement OR peaceful coexistence
- [ ] First external contributor (outside core team)
- [ ] Widget running in at least one real MCP deployment
- [ ] Security documentation contributed to ecosystem

**Month 3:**
- [ ] 3+ widgets available (GitHub, Filesystem, etc.)
- [ ] mcp-ui compatibility proven with real usage
- [ ] 100+ GitHub stars (showing community interest)
- [ ] No major conflicts with ecosystem

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå Launch without ecosystem buy-in
‚ùå Claim to be "the standard" for MCP UIs
‚ùå Compete with Anthropic or mcp-ui
‚ùå Over-engineer before proving value
‚ùå Ignore feedback from maintainers
‚ùå Create confusion in ecosystem
‚ùå Use aggressive marketing or FUD tactics

## Current Status

**Last Updated**: [Date]

**mcp-ui Outreach**: ‚è≥ Not started
- Waiting for demo video and repo cleanup
- Target: Week 1

**Anthropic Outreach**: ‚è≥ Not started
- Waiting for mcp-ui response first
- Target: Week 2

**Decision Status**: ‚è≥ Pending
- Will decide after both outreach attempts
- Target: Week 4

   - [ ] Monitor for response
   - [ ] Engage constructively with any feedback

3. **Week 2**
   - [ ] Send Anthropic outreach using template
   - [ ] Continue mcp-ui dialogue if positive
   - [ ] Document any concerns or objections

4. **Week 3-4**
   - [ ] Evaluate all feedback
   - [ ] Make GO/NO-GO decision
   - [ ] Create public announcement if proceeding
   - [ ] Or sunset project if not proceeding

## Questions?

If you're a contributor wondering about collaboration strategy:
- Read this README first
- Check CONTRIBUTING.md for our philosophy
- Don't make claims about official status
- When in doubt, emphasize collaboration over competition
- Ask in GitHub Discussions before external communications

**Remember**: We're here to help the MCP ecosystem, not to compete with it.
