# MWP Collaboration Strategy

This directory contains templates and guidance for collaborating with the MCP ecosystem.

## Philosophy

**MWP provides dashboard observability for MCP servers.**

We're seeking Anthropic's feedback to ensure our approach aligns with the MCP ecosystem vision.

## What MWP Is

**MCP Widget Protocol (MWP)** is a client-side dashboard standard for:
- Operational monitoring of MCP servers
- User confirmation before tool execution
- Audit logging for compliance
- Administrative control interfaces

**Separate from mcp-ui**: mcp-ui delivers rich UI **in** MCP responses. MWP provides external dashboards **about** MCP servers. They're complementary, not competitive.

## Outreach Plan

### Week 1: Anthropic Alignment
- **File**: [ANTHROPIC-OUTREACH.md](./ANTHROPIC-OUTREACH.md)
- **Action**: Post in MCP GitHub Discussions
- **Goal**: Get feedback, ensure no conflicts with MCP roadmap
- **Success**: Positive response or at least no objection

### Week 2-3: Evaluate and Decide
Based on responses, make GO/NO-GO decision for continued development.

## Decision Framework

### GO Criteria (Proceed with Development)
- ‚úÖ Positive response from Anthropic
- ‚úÖ No objection after reasonable outreach
- ‚úÖ Clear that dashboards are a real ecosystem need
- ‚úÖ Value proposition remains strong

### NO-GO Criteria (Pause or Pivot)
- ‚ùå Explicit objection from Anthropic
- ‚ùå Anthropic announces competing solution
- ‚ùå Fundamental conflicts with MCP direction
- ‚ùå Technical/security concerns we can't address

### PIVOT Criteria (Adjust Approach)
- üîÑ Feedback suggests different direction
- üîÑ Better alignment opportunity identified
- üîÑ Ecosystem needs evolve

## What We're Offering

### To Anthropic MCP Team
1. Dashboard observability patterns for MCP ecosystem
2. Reference implementation for secure operational monitoring
3. Community contribution to MCP documentation
4. Real-world testing and feedback
5. Enterprise operational use cases

### To Developers
1. Standardized way to build MCP server dashboards
2. Type-safe widget development (TypeScript)
3. Security built-in by default
4. Observability for debugging
5. Clear documentation and examples

## Key Principles

1. **Client-Side Only**
   - No modifications to MCP protocol
   - Works with any standard MCP server
   - Purely additive observability layer

2. **Complementary to mcp-ui**
   - mcp-ui: Rich UI in responses
   - MWP: External dashboards about servers
   - Different use cases, both valuable

3. **Listen and Adapt**
   - Feedback from Anthropic takes priority
   - Willing to pivot based on ecosystem needs
   - No ego about "our way"

4. **Be Honest**
   - Don't claim official status without approval
   - Acknowledge community-driven nature
   - Transparent about limitations

5. **Focus on Value**
   - Operational monitoring is a real need
   - Solve actual problems
   - Validate with real users

## Success Metrics

**Month 1:**
- [ ] Outreach completed to Anthropic
- [ ] Positive response or constructive feedback
- [ ] Demo showing dashboard observability
- [ ] GitHub repo public with simplified spec

**Month 2:**
- [ ] Clear that no conflicts with MCP ecosystem
- [ ] First external contributor
- [ ] Dashboard running in at least one deployment
- [ ] Documentation contributed to ecosystem

**Month 3:**
- [ ] 3+ dashboard widgets available
- [ ] Proven value for operational monitoring
- [ ] Community interest shown
- [ ] No major conflicts with ecosystem

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå Launch without Anthropic feedback
‚ùå Claim to be "the standard" for MCP dashboards
‚ùå Ignore feedback from Anthropic
‚ùå Create confusion with mcp-ui
‚ùå Over-engineer before proving value
‚ùå Use aggressive marketing

## Current Status

**Last Updated**: [Date]

**Anthropic Outreach**: ‚è≥ Not started
- Waiting for demo and repo cleanup
- Target: Week 1

**Decision Status**: ‚è≥ Pending
- Will decide after outreach attempt
- Target: Week 3

## Files in This Directory

- **README.md** (this file) - Overview and strategy
- **ANTHROPIC-OUTREACH.md** - Template for contacting Anthropic
- *[Future]* **RESPONSE-LOG.md** - Track actual responses received

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week)**
   - [ ] Record demo video showing dashboard monitoring
   - [ ] Clean up GitHub repo for public visibility
   - [ ] Prepare demo deployment
   - [ ] Fill in placeholder links

2. **Week 1**
   - [ ] Send Anthropic outreach using template
   - [ ] Monitor for response
   - [ ] Engage constructively with feedback

3. **Week 2-3**
   - [ ] Evaluate feedback
   - [ ] Make GO/NO-GO decision
   - [ ] Create public announcement if proceeding
   - [ ] Or sunset project if needed

## Questions?

If you're a contributor wondering about collaboration strategy:
- Read this README first
- Don't make claims about official status
- When in doubt, emphasize "dashboard observability for MCP"
- Ask in GitHub Discussions before external communications

---

**Remember**: We're here to help the MCP ecosystem with dashboard observability, not to create confusion or compete with existing solutions like mcp-ui.
