# MWP Strategy: Prove Value First

**Last Updated**: October 2025

## What MWP Is

**MCP Widget Protocol (MWP)** is a client-side dashboard standard for MCP server observability.

- **Not**: UI in MCP responses (that's mcp-ui)
- **Is**: External dashboards showing MCP operations (like Grafana for observability)

## Current Status

- ✅ Core packages implemented (EventBus, MCPBridge, Configuration)
- ✅ Several example widgets (GitHub, Filesystem, Stripe, etc.)
- ✅ Working TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Simplified specification written
- ⏳ No external validation yet
- ⏳ No real users yet
- ⏳ Anthropic feedback pending

## Phase 1: Validate (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal**: Confirm there's actual demand for MCP dashboard observability

### Week 1: Anthropic Feedback
- [ ] Post in MCP Discussions (template ready)
- [ ] Ask: Is dashboard observability needed?
- [ ] Ask: Any conflicts with MCP roadmap?
- [ ] Ask: Confusion with mcp-ui?

### Week 2: Build Demo
- [ ] Clean working demo showing:
  - Real-time tool invocation monitoring
  - User confirmation before execution
  - Audit log of operations
  - Multiple MCP servers in one dashboard
- [ ] Deploy demo publicly
- [ ] Record 3-minute walkthrough video

### Week 3: Get Real Feedback
- [ ] Share demo with 5-10 MCP users
- [ ] Ask: Would you use this?
- [ ] Ask: What's missing?
- [ ] Listen more than talk

### Week 4: GO/NO-GO Decision

**GO if**:
- Anthropic gives positive feedback or no objection
- At least 3 people say "I'd use this"
- Clear the dashboard need is real

**NO-GO if**:
- Anthropic objects
- Nobody wants it
- Better solved another way

## Phase 2: Prove Value (Months 2-3)

**Only if Phase 1 says GO**

### Build 3 Core Widgets
Focus on most common MCP servers:
1. **GitHub** - Show tool activity, approve PRs/issues
2. **Filesystem** - Monitor file operations, approve writes
3. **Generic** - Works with any MCP server (auto-generates from schema)

### Get 3 Real Users
- Personal projects are fine
- Document what they actually use
- Iterate based on feedback

### Write Simple Docs
- "Getting Started in 5 minutes"
- "Building Your First Widget"
- "How This Differs from mcp-ui"
- That's it. No more.

## Phase 3: Grow (Months 4-6)

**Only if Phase 2 shows real usage**

### Community
- Accept external contributions
- Help 3-5 people build their own widgets
- Create Discord if demand warrants it

### Ecosystem
- Document best practices
- Share learnings with MCP community
- Contribute to MCP docs if appropriate

### Sustainability
- If growing: Consider how to maintain long-term
- If stagnant: Archive gracefully

## What We're NOT Doing

❌ Competing with mcp-ui
❌ Building marketplaces
❌ Creating foundations
❌ Planning conferences
❌ Raising money
❌ Claiming to be "the standard"
❌ Over-engineering before validation

## Success Metrics

### Month 1
- ✅ Anthropic feedback received
- ✅ Demo deployed and working
- ✅ 3-5 people tried it

### Month 3
- 3+ real users (not us)
- 3 core widgets stable
- Clear documentation
- No major pivot needed

### Month 6
- 10+ users OR decision to archive
- Community contributing OR we stop
- Clear value proven OR we pivot

## Budget

**Current**: $0 (volunteer time)

**Phase 1-2**: $0 (just time and hosting ~$10/mo)

**Phase 3**: Maybe $100-500 for tools if we get traction

That's it. Prove value before spending money.

## Key Principles

1. **Prove value first** - Everything else is premature
2. **Stay focused** - Dashboards for MCP, nothing more
3. **Listen** - User feedback > our assumptions
4. **Be honest** - If it's not working, stop
5. **Stay humble** - We're one approach, not the approach

## Relationship to Other Projects

**mcp-ui**: Complementary (response UI vs dashboards)
**Anthropic MCP**: Extension, not modification
**Other tools**: Learn from them, don't compete

## Decision Points

**After Week 4**: GO/NO-GO based on feedback
**After Month 3**: GROW/MAINTAIN/ARCHIVE based on usage
**After Month 6**: SCALE/SUNSET based on trajectory

## Questions to Keep Asking

- Is anyone actually using this?
- Are we solving a real problem?
- Is this the right solution?
- Should we pivot or stop?

## If Things Go Wrong

**No traction**: Archive gracefully, document learnings
**Anthropic objects**: Stop immediately, respect their vision
**Better solution emerges**: Celebrate it, contribute if possible
**We lose interest**: Hand off or archive, don't abandon

## Current Action Item

**This week**: Send Anthropic outreach, build demo, get feedback.

That's the entire strategy. Prove value before anything else.
