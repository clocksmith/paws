# Archive

This directory contains documents that were over-engineered or premature for the current project stage.

## Why These Were Archived

**Date**: October 2025
**Reason**: Pivot to collaboration-first strategy with mcp-ui

### Archived Documents

- `MWP.md` - 25,000 token specification that over-engineered the solution
- `strategy/SHORT-TERM-STRATEGY.md` - Strategy document treating future events as accomplished
- `strategy/WIDGET-ROADMAP.md` - Premature roadmap with widget bounties and certification programs

### Problems with Original Approach

1. **Over-specification**: 25k token spec when mcp-ui succeeds with simple iframe approach
2. **Competition vs Collaboration**: Designed competing protocol instead of enhancing mcp-ui
3. **Premature Planning**: Budget plans, hackathons, marketplaces before proving value
4. **Feature Creep**: 60 design tokens, agent collaboration protocol, performance budgets

### New Direction

See `MWP-SIMPLE.md` for the simplified specification focused on:
- Security (user confirmation before tool execution)
- Observability (event-driven architecture)
- Compatibility (works with existing mcp-ui)
- Simplicity (<5000 token spec)

### Lessons Learned

1. Ship working code first, spec second
2. Collaborate with existing solutions (mcp-ui) rather than compete
3. Start simple, add complexity only when proven necessary
4. Get ecosystem buy-in (Anthropic) before building infrastructure

These documents remain available for historical reference and contain valuable technical insights, but they represent a direction the project chose not to pursue.
