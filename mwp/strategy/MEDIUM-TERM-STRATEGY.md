# MCP Widget Protocol: Medium-Term Strategy (Weeks 5–16)

## Purpose

With launch traction established, the medium-term focus is scaling the ecosystem: grow the widget library, cultivate an engaged community, keep the specification ahead of adopters, and validate monetizable pathways. This window spans Weeks 5–16 and bridges the gap between initial adoption and sustainable market leadership.

## Specification Roadmap Alignment

### Delivered in v1.0.0
- Agent collaboration contract (`WidgetAPI.agent`) with host policies in Sections 3.5 and 17.
- Performance budgets for bundle size, render time, and memory (Section 18).
- Offline resilience via `OfflineCache` and host notifications (Sections 6.5, 10.3).
- Telemetry interface with consent-aware tracking (Sections 6.6, 10.3).
- Internationalization contract for locale-aware widgets (Sections 6.7, 10.3).

### Backlog to Tackle Next
1. Multimodal widget outputs (audio/video/3D slots and media renderers).
2. Real-time collaboration (`CollabStore`, presence, conflict handling).
3. AI-generated widget scaffolding (intent schema + CLI/endpoint).
4. Extensible hook system (lifecycle interceptors for hosts).
5. Marketplace & monetization primitives (pricing metadata, receipts).
6. Widget version migration contract (`api.migrate`, manifest rules).
7. Edge/WebAssembly runtime for high-performance workloads.

### Prioritization
- **Next Release (v1.1):** #1–#5 above.
- **Mid-Term (v1.2):** #6–#7.
- **Future Research:** Monetization compliance tooling and collaboration analytics once shared state launches.

### Spec Execution Timeline (Months 1–12)
1. **Phase 1 (Months 1–3):** Draft multimodal and collaboration specs, define hooks & migration schema, design marketplace licensing primitives.
2. **Phase 2 (Months 4–6):** Ship sample widgets (audio/video + collaborative), deliver host middleware for hooks/migrations, prototype marketplace with signed receipts.
3. **Phase 3 (Months 7–12):** Release AI scaffolding CLI, run monetized widget beta, pilot WASM sandbox with partners.
4. **Phase 4 (Year 2):** Operationalize migration services, productize AI scaffolding/WASM libraries, enrich marketplace analytics.

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Development (Weeks 5–12)

### Step 5 – Community Infrastructure
- Stand up Discord with #announcements, #general, #widget-showcase, #help, #spec-discussion, #jobs.
- Automate onboarding (welcome bot, role assignment) and run monthly community calls.
- Launch GitHub Discussions (Q&A, Ideas, Show & Tell, RFCs) with templated issues.
- Publish widget showcase (widgetregistry.dev/showcase) with submission workflow, sorting, and filtering.
- Incentivize contributions via weekly spotlights and homepage promotions.
- **Targets:** 500+ Discord members, 50+ discussion threads, 20+ showcase submissions by Week 12.

### Step 6 – Official Widgets & Partnerships
- Expand official widget set to eight (add Supabase, Vercel, Stripe).
- Meet gold-standard quality (≥90% test coverage, validator clean pass, full docs).
- Execute partnership program with top 20 MCP server maintainers (widget built in exchange for co-marketing, README badges, webinars).
- **Metrics:** 10+ partnerships, 50% co-promoting to their user base, 5+ partners contributing back to the spec.
- **Budget:** $8,000 development + $1,000 incentives | Timeline: Weeks 5–10.

### Step 7 – “MCP Widget Jam” Hackathon (Week 8)
- 48-hour GitHub/Devpost hackathon with $6,000 prize pool (grand prize, runner-ups, category awards).
- Provide 24/7 Discord support, live Q&As, starter templates, validation tooling.
- Secure sponsorship to extend prizes (Anthropic, Vercel, etc.).
- Post-event, add qualifying widgets to showcase and publish deep-dive case studies.
- **Targets:** 30–40 submissions, 20+ validator-passing widgets, 6K+ social impressions during event.

## Phase 4 (Early): Market Leadership Foundations (Weeks 9–16)

### Step 8 – Discovery Channel Saturation
- Secure placement in `awesome-mcp-*` lists and similar curated resources.
- Launch “Widget Available” README badge and incentivize adoption (promoted search placement).
- Optimize npm packages (keywords, descriptions, tutorials) and pitch npm highlights/blog.
- **Goal:** 5+ curated list inclusions, 50+ READMEs displaying badge, measurable referral traffic uplift.

### Step 9 – Thought Leadership & Influencer Activation
- Deliver conference talk (e.g., AI Engineer Summit) with live coding demo + optional workshop.
- Activate 10 influencers (Theo Browne, Fireship, Swyx, etc.) with honorariums, concierge support, and featured placement.
- Secure three podcast appearances (Latent Space, Practical AI, JS Party) with recap content.
- **Budget:** $6,000 | Timeline: Weeks 10–16.

## Community & Product KPIs (Medium-Term Focus)

**Developer Engagement:**
- ≥50 GitHub stars/week, 20% DAU on Discord, average widget build time <10 minutes.
- ≥5 new widgets/week and 75% maintenance rate (updated within 90 days).

**Ecosystem Health:**
- ≥4/5 average widget quality score, 90% validator pass rate on first submission.
- Contributor diversity goal: 100 unique widget authors from 20+ countries by Month 12.

**Enterprise Pipeline:**
- 10 pilot programs by Month 6, 3 podcast appearances, conference talk delivered.

These milestones ensure MWP matures into a vibrant, self-sustaining ecosystem before the long-term marketplace and governance initiatives take over.
