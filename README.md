# PAWS

AI development tools for practical multi-agent workflows and recursive self-improvement. PAWS CLI orchestrates competitive code generation across multiple LLMs with automated testing. REPLOID is a browser-native agent that evolves its own code at runtime. MCP Lens provides protocol-semantic analysis for understanding tool interactions beyond simple metrics.

For experiments with local models and multi-model mixing, see [gamma](https://github.com/clocksmith/gamma).

## Projects

Three operationally independent tools, unified by recursive improvement:
- **[REPLOID](reploid/README.md)** - Browser-native agent that evolves by modifying its own runtime code
- **[PAWS CLI](packages/cli-js/README.md)** - Orchestrates competitive code generation by pitting multiple LLMs against each other
- **[MCP Lens](lens/README.md)** - Analyzes protocol interactions to reveal patterns beyond surface metrics

## REPLOID

**R**ecursive **E**volution **P**rotocol **L**oop **O**ptimizing **I**ntelligent **DREAMER**
(**D**ynamic **R**ecursive **E**ngine **A**dapting **M**odules **E**volving **R**EPLOID)
→ REPLOID ↔ DREAMER ↔ ∞

Browser-native agent with 3 RSI levels: creates tools, improves its tool-creation mechanism, and modifies its own core modules. Supports 24 built-in tools and multiple LLM providers.

## PAWS CLI

**P**repare **A**rtifacts **W**ith **SWAP** (**S**treamlined **W**rite **A**fter **P**AWS)
→ PAWS → SWAP → PAWS → SWAP → ∞

Multi-agent code generation with competitive LLM workflows. Core tools bundle and apply changes (`cats`/`dogs`), while arena mode enables model competition with automated testing.

## MCP Lens

Protocol-semantic analysis for MCP servers. Reveals tool invocation patterns, failure causality, and efficiency metrics through client-side Web Components without requiring server modifications.
