# PAWS

AI development tools for practical multi-agent workflows and RSI (Recursive Self-Improvement). 

**P**repare **A**rtifacts **W**ith **S**WAP (**S**treamlined **W**rite **A**fter **P**AWS) → PAWS → SWAP → PAWS → SWAP → ∞

---

## Projects

Three operationally independent tools, unified by recursive improvement:

- **[REPLOID](reploid/README.md)** - Browser-native agent that evolves by modifying its own runtime code
- **[PAWS CLI](packages/cli-py/README.md)** - Orchestrates competitive code generation by pitting multiple LLMs against each other
- **[MCP Lens](lens/README.md)** - Analyzes protocol interactions to reveal patterns beyond surface metrics

## REPLOID

**R**ecursive **E**volution **P**rotocol **L**oop **O**ptimizing **I**ntelligent **DREAMER**
(**D**ynamic **R**ecursive **E**ngine **A**dapting **M**odules **E**volving **R**EPLOID)
→ REPLOID ↔ DREAMER ↔ ∞

Browser-native agent with 3 RSI levels:

1. creates tools
2. improves its tool-creation mechanism
3. modifies its own core modules.

## PAWS CLI

**P**repare **A**rtifacts **W**ith **SWAP** (**S**treamlined **W**rite **A**fter **P**AWS)
→ PAWS → SWAP → PAWS → SWAP → ∞

Multi-agent code generation with competitive LLM workflows. Core tools bundle and apply changes (`cats`/`dogs`), while arena mode enables model competition with automated testing.

## MCP Lens

Protocol-semantic analysis for MCP servers. Reveals tool invocation patterns, failure causality, and efficiency metrics through client-side Web Components without requiring server modifications.
