# PAWS

> **DEPRECATED (November 2025)**
>
> PAWS was designed to orchestrate multiple AI models for coding tasks. This functionality has been absorbed by platform incumbents:
>
> - **GitHub Copilot**: Auto model selection routes requests to GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini automatically
> - **Google Antigravity**: Agent-first IDE with autonomous planning, execution, and verification via Gemini 3 Pro
> - **Claude Agent SDK**: Native subagent parallelization—run 10+ Claude instances simultaneously
>
> PAWS's Arena Mode (test-driven model selection) remains conceptually novel but impractical at 3x cost/latency. This codebase is archived for historical reference. Thank you to everyone who contributed ideas and feedback during development.

## PAWS CLI

**P**repare **A**rtifacts **W**ith **SWAP** (**S**treamlined **W**rite **A**fter **P**AWS)
→ PAWS → SWAP → PAWS → SWAP → ∞

Multi-agent code generation with competitive LLM workflows. Core tools bundle and apply changes (`cats`/`dogs`), while arena mode enables model competition with automated testing.
