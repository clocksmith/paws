python3 -m http.server 8000

# Option B: Node.js with live reload
npm install
npm run dev

# Option C: Any static server
npx serve -p 8000
```

### Step 2: Open in Browser

Navigate to **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

### Step 3: Choose Your Configuration (NEW!)

You'll see the **Simple Mode** tab by default with 3 clear options:

#### ‚ö° Minimal RSI Core (Recommended - Selected by Default)
- **8 essential modules** only
- Fastest startup, agent can self-evolve by loading more modules as needed
- Perfect for learning and experimentation

#### üìö Core + All Blueprints
- 8 core modules + 26 knowledge documents
- Agent has maximum knowledge from the start
- Great for complex tasks requiring deep understanding

#### üöÄ All Upgrades + Blueprints
- 40 modules + 26 blueprints
- Full power from the start
- Best for production use or advanced workflows

**Advanced Options:**
- **Templates Tab** - Pre-configured personas (Website Builder, RSI Lab, RFC Author, etc.)
- **Hunter Protocol** - Manual module/blueprint selection for experts

### Step 4: Set Your First Goal

Type a goal in the input box and click **"Launch Agent"**. Examples:

**With Minimal RSI Core (default):**
```
Create a simple hello world function
```

```
Analyze my current module architecture
```

**With All Blueprints:**
```
Study blueprint 0x000016 and create a new tool
```

**With All Upgrades:**
```
Create a landing page for a coffee shop called "Bean There"
```

The Sentinel Agent will start working through its FSM states automatically!

## üéØ Interactive Tutorial

### Example 1: Building a Website (Easiest)

**Persona:** Website Builder

**Goal:** `Create a simple landing page for a yoga studio`

**What happens:**
1. ‚è≥ **CURATING_CONTEXT** - Agent selects HTML/CSS/JS template files
2. ‚úã **AWAITING_CONTEXT_APPROVAL** - Review selected files (click "Approve")
3. üß† **PLANNING_WITH_CONTEXT** - Agent analyzes requirements
4. üìù **GENERATING_PROPOSAL** - Creates HTML/CSS/JS files
5. ‚úã **AWAITING_PROPOSAL_APPROVAL** - **Review changes in interactive diff viewer**
   - ‚úì Green = additions
   - ‚úó Red = deletions
   - üëÅÔ∏è Side-by-side comparison
   - Click "Approve All" or selectively approve files
6. ‚öôÔ∏è **APPLYING_CHANGES** - Writes files to VFS
7. üîç **REFLECTING** - Agent learns from the outcome
8. ‚úÖ **DONE** - View your site in the **Live Preview** panel!

### Example 2: Self-Improvement Experiment (Advanced)

**Persona:** RSI Lab Sandbox

**Goal:** `Study blueprint 0x000016 and create a new tool named 'greet_user' that returns a friendly message`

**What happens:**
1. Agent reads `/blueprints/0x000016-meta-tool-creation-patterns.md`
2. Agent proposes creating `upgrades/tools-dynamic/greet_user.json`
3. You review the proposed tool definition
4. Agent applies the change to its own toolset
5. **The agent has now improved itself!** üéâ

### Example 3: Code Analysis (Intermediate)

**Persona:** Code Refactorer

**Goal:** `Analyze state-manager.js for potential performance optimizations`

**What happens:**
1. Agent uses **Introspector** module to analyze code complexity
2. Agent uses **PerformanceMonitor** to check current metrics
3. Agent proposes refactoring patterns (memoization, debouncing, lazy loading)
4. You review proposals in diff viewer
5. Agent applies approved changes and runs self-tests

---

## üîë Key Concepts

### PAWS Philosophy
**Prepare Artifacts With SWAP**

- **cats.md**: Context bundles (selected files for LLM)
- **dogs.md**: Change proposals (explicit modifications)
- Human approvals at 2 checkpoints

### Sentinel Agent FSM
8-state finite state machine ensures controlled execution:
```
IDLE ‚Üí CURATING ‚Üí AWAITING_APPROVAL ‚Üí PLANNING ‚Üí
GENERATING ‚Üí AWAITING_APPROVAL ‚Üí APPLYING ‚Üí REFLECTING ‚Üí DONE
```

### Virtual File System (VFS)
- All files stored in browser IndexedDB
- Git-based version control
- Checkpoint/rollback capability
- Syncs to real filesystem via File System Access API

### RSI (Recursive Self-Improvement)
The agent can modify its own source code:
- Tool creation (`tools-write.json` provides `create_tool` function)
- Goal modification (`goal-modifier.js` for safe goal evolution)
- Blueprint creation (`blueprint-creator.js` for knowledge transfer)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Failed to load module"
**Solution:** Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) and refresh

### Problem: Agent stuck in CURATING_CONTEXT
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Likely API key issue or network problem.

### Problem: Diff viewer shows no changes
**Solution:** Agent may have proposed empty changeset. Check "Agent Thoughts" panel for reasoning.

### Problem: IndexedDB quota exceeded
**Solution:** Export important sessions, then run `StateManager.clearAllData()` in console

### Problem: Preview not showing
**Solution:** Ensure persona is Website Builder or Product Prototype Factory. Check that `/vfs/preview/index.html` exists.

### Problem: File System Access denied
**Solution:** Browser APIs panel ‚Üí "üìÅ Connect Directory" button. Grant permission to directory.

### Problem: Self-tests failing
**Solution:** Check Self-Tests panel for failure details. Common causes:
- Missing dependencies in module
- Tool execution errors
- IndexedDB corruption
